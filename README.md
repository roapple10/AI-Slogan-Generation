## Setup

### Option 1: Local Setup

1. Install Dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Configure Environment Variables
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env file and add your GOOGLE_API_KEY
   ```

3. Run Application
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

### Option 2: Docker Setup (Recommended)

1. Create a `.env` file with your environment variables:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   MODEL_NAME=gemini-2.0-flash
   ```

2. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t slogan-generator .
   ```

3. Run the container using the environment file:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8501:8501 --env-file .env slogan-generator  
   ```
Then go to http://localhost:8501/

Alternative ways to run the container:

1. Using command line arguments:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8501:8501 \
     -e GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here \
     -e MODEL_NAME=gemini-pro \
     slogan-generator
   ```

2. Using Docker Compose (recommended for development):
   Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:
   ```yaml
   version: '3'
   services:
     slogan-generator:
       build: .
       ports:
         - "8501:8501"
       env_file:
         - .env
   ```
   Then run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

**Security Best Practices:**
- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file
- Use different API keys for development and production
- Consider using Docker secrets for production environments
- Use environment variables for sensitive data instead of hardcoding them in the Dockerfile

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following content:
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## System Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher (for local setup)
- Docker (for containerized setup)
- Google API Key
- Internet connection
